h1. Introduction

The Query API is loosely modeled after Facebook's [Query Language|https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/fql/].

The REST API took inspiration from several successful REST APIs:
* Facebook's [Graph API|https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/]
* Google's [Data Protocol|http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/docs/2.0/basics.html]
* The [Open Data Protocol|http://www.odata.org/developers/protocols/overview]

See [PLFM:Service API Design] for more information regarding the rationale and design details.

h2. Encoding

The primary request and response encoding for the service is JSON.  Here's a handy tool to make a blob of JSON more readable: [http://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/]

In responses from the service, dates are serialized as long integers expressing epoch time - the number of seconds elapsed since midnight Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) of January 1, 1970, not counting leap seconds.  Here's a handy tool to convert from epoch time to human readable dates: [http://www.epochconverter.com/]

In requests to the service, dates can be serialized either as long integers expressing epoch time or human readable dates in [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt |RFC 3339] format such as '2011-01-31' or '2011-01-31T22:00:00'

h2. Security

Eventually these services will be HTTPS only and disallow HTTP.  For all requests requiring authentication, users will pass a special header {{sessionToken}} with
each request to the service.
